Algorithm:

1. Read the integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of boys and girls, respectively.
2. Declare an integer variable `pairs` and initialize it to 0, representing the count of pairs formed.
3. Declare two arrays `a[]` and `b[]` of size `n` and `m` respectively, to store the dancing skills of boys and girls.
4. Read the dancing skills of boys into the array `a[]`.
5. Read the dancing skills of girls into the array `b[]`.
6. Sort the arrays `a[]` and `b[]` in non-decreasing order of dancing skills.
7. Iterate through each boy's dancing skill in the array `a[]`:
   a. For each boy's dancing skill, iterate through each girl's dancing skill in the array `b[]`.
   b. If the absolute difference between the dancing skills of the current boy and girl is less than 2:
      - Increment the `pairs` count.
      - Mark the girl as unavailable by assigning a high value (1000) to her skill level in the `b[]` array.
      - Break out of the inner loop to move to the next boy.
8. Print the value of `pairs`, which represents the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with the given constraints.

This algorithm efficiently determines the largest possible number of pairs that can be formed from `n` boys and `m` girls while ensuring that the partners' dancing skills in each pair differ by at most one.
