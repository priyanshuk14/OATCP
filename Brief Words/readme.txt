Algorithm:
    1. Generating Short Forms:
        For each word in the dictionary:
            Create short forms of length 1 to 4 characters.
            If a short form is not already used for another word, assign it to the current word.
            If a short form is already used for another word, mark it as not unique.
    2. Main Steps:
        Prepare two lists of words.
        Generate short forms for the words in the second list.
        Show the short forms and the words they represent.
