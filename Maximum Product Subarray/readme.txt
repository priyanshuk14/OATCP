Algorithm:

1. Define a function `solve` that takes an array `arr[]` of integers and its size `n` as input.
2. Initialize a variable `res` to store the maximum product found so far. Set it to the smallest possible integer value.
3. Initialize a variable `temp` to 1 to start calculating the product of subarrays.
4. Iterate through the array `arr[]` from left to right:
    a. Update `temp` by multiplying it with the current element of the array.
    b. Update `res` to the maximum of `temp` and `res`.
    c. If the current element is 0, reset `temp` to 1 to start calculating the product for the next subarray.
5. Reset `temp` to 1.
6. Iterate through the array `arr[]` from right to left:
    a. Update `temp` by multiplying it with the current element of the array.
    b. Update `res` to the maximum of `res` and `temp`.
    c. If the current element is 0, reset `temp` to 1 to start calculating the product for the next subarray.
7. Return the final value of `res`, which represents the maximum product of a subarray within the given array.

Main Function:

1. Read the size of the array `n` from the standard input.
2. Declare an array `numbers[]` of size `n`.
3. Read `n` integers into the array `numbers[]`.
4. Call the `solve` function with the array `numbers[]` and `n`, storing the result in `maxProduct`.
5. Print `maxProduct` to the standard output.
6. End the program.
